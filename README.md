# macNXLauncher
MacNXLauncher is a payload injector/toolkit for Nintendo Switch. This will be built with swift and it's only going to be a GUI for fusee-gelee exploit. So basically this is just a more user-friendly version of fusee-launcher.

# Plans
- SD Card mounter.
- Updating *SUPPORTED* Custom Firmwares. (ReiNX and Atmosphere at the first stage)
- Setting up *SUPPORTED* Custom Firmwares. (ReiNX and Atmosphere at the first stage again)

# Credits
Thanks to @Qyriad for his great effort on fusee-launcher it was very easy to modify and use !

# Responsibility
I'm not reponsible for anything. Dead switches included.
